# Placeholder question - do not use

We have a variable `lunch_menu`, set equal to an list of lunch menu items:

```ruby
lunch_menu = ["pizza", "sandwich", "sushi", "soup", "salad"]
```

Since you're super hungry and super excited about lunch, use the `for loop`
method to enumerate over the list and output a string to the terminal with each
lunch menu item with an `"!"` at the end.

Which piece of code will achieve the desired result? Select all that apply:

## Correct

```ruby
for item in lunch_menu: print(item + "!")
```

> Correct! Using `for` lets us access each element of the list in the block, and
> we can output a string by using `print`.

## Incorrect

```ruby
print(lunch_menu + "!")
```

> This code would result in an error, since `lunch_menu` is a list, and we can't
> us the `+` method to add a string to the list. How can we iterate over each
> element?

## Incorrect

```ruby
for item in lunch_menu: item + "!"
```

> Using `for` lets us access each element of the list in the block, but this
> method doesn't output anything to the terminal since we aren't using `print`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
